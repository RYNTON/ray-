Toyota GR86
2022 toyota gr 86 front
The second-generation Toyota GR86 follows the same rear-wheel-drive formula as the first-gen car. Developed again in conjunction with the Subaru BRZ, the GR86 will be powered by a horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine and a standard six-speed manual transmission. This time around, Toyota has addressed our principal complaint with the last generation and has given the GR86 more horsepower for 2022. The new model is powered by a 2.4-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that makes 228 horsepower, which is 23 hp more than the outgoing model's 2.0-liter mill. The result is a phenomenal driving experience for the price, a combo that's worthy of spots on our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists.
